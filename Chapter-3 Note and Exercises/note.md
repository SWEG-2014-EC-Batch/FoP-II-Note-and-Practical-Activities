### üñ•Ô∏è File Handling (Management) <a name="file_handling"></a>

- File handling is a mechanism to store the output of a program in a file and perform various operations on it.
- The flow of data between file and program is referred to as File stream.
   - **File Input Stream** ‚Äì reads data from a disk  file to the program
   - **File output Stream** ‚Äì writes data to the disk file from the program

### üñ•Ô∏è C++ Stream Class Hierarchy <a name="stream_classes"></a>

- Each file stream is associated with a particular class, which contains member functions and definitions for dealing with a particular kind of data flow.
- The I/O system of C++ provides the following stream classes which have access to standard I/O stream objects and file functions.

### üñ•Ô∏è Types of File <a name="file_types"></a>

- There are two types of files in which the streams are linked, namely **Text File** and **Binary File**.

 ### Text File
- A sequence of readable characters separated by space and newline characters.
- Character translations may occur as required by the host environment
- There may not be a one-to-one relationship between the characters that are written (or read) and those on the external device. 

### Binary File
- A sequence of bytes with a one-to-one correspondence to those in the external device.
   - _The number of bytes written (or read) is the same as the number on the external device_
- No character translations required
   - _Data stored to disk in the same  form in which it is represented in main  memory_
   - _As a result, saving data in binary format is faster and takes less space_
- Human unreadable
   - _If you ever try to edit a binary file for example containing numbers you will see that the numbers  appear as nonsense characters_
   - _Do not normally use  anything to separate the data into lines_
- Binary format data can not easily be transferred from one computer to another due to variations in the internal representation of the data from computer to computer.

### üñ•Ô∏è File Manipulation Process <a name="file_manipulation"></a>

- Before actually start using and manipulate files, it is important to discuss the steps to be followed in order to process files.
- Here are the steps that need to be followed in order to perform successful file operations through your program
   - **_Step 1: Declaration of the file stream object_**
   - **_Step 2: Opening a file (attach file stream with a specific file)_**
   - **_Step 3: Check for the successful opening of the file (optional)_**
   - **_Step 4: Perform File Read/Write Operations_**
   - **_Step 5: Closing a file_**
   
- To perform file read and write (I/O), it is mandatory to include the header file **fstream.h** which defines several classes and functions. 

### üñ•Ô∏è File modes/offsets <a name="file_modess"></a>

### üñ•Ô∏è File Random Access <a name="random_access"></a>

- Basically, there are two types of file access: sequential and random

### File Pointers

- Each file object has two integer values  associated with it
  
  - **_get pointer_**
   - **_put pointer_**

- The values of the pointers specify the byte number in the  file where reading or writing will take  place.
- By default
  
  - **_reading pointer_** is set at the **_beginning_**
   - **_writing pointer_** is set at the **_end_** (when the file open is opened in ios::app or ios::ate mode)

### Random Access 

- Allow you to read from and write to an arbitrary location in the file.
- The **seekg()** and **tellg()** functions allow you to set and examine the get pointer.
- The **seekp()** and **tellp()** functions allow you to set and examine the put pointer.

**(1) tellg() and tellp()**

- Does not has any parameter
- Used to get the current file pointer position
- **_tellg()_** ‚Äì returns the current pointer position for reading
- **_tellp()_** ‚Äì returns the current pointer position for writing

**(2) seekg() and seekp()**

- Used to set (specify) the file pointer position for reading and writing respectively
- Syntax:
  
        stream-object.seekg(size in byte, offset)
        stream-object.seekp(size in byte, offset)

- Example

        fstream inf;
   	    inf.open(‚Äúmyfile.txt‚Äù, ios::in | ios::out);
   	    inf.seekg(24, ios::beg);    //move get pointer 24 bytes from beginning 
   	    inf.seekp(-8, ios::end);   //move put pointer 8 bytes from end of file 
   	    inf.seekg(4, ios::curr);  //move get pointer 4 bytes from current position
