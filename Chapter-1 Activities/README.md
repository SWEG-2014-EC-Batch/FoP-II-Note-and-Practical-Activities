### üñ•Ô∏è What is Function? <a name="what-is-function"></a>

- A function is a building of modular programming which is a block of code (subprogram) that performs a specific task.
- In modular programming complex tasks should be broken down into multiple functions.
- Each function can be called in turn when it is needed.
- A function can accept an input, act on data (process the input), and can return a value (produces an output).

### üñ•Ô∏è Components of a Function <a name="components"></a>
- Function name
- Function arguments (parameters)
 -Function body
 -Return type
 
 The figure below depicts the components of a function.

### üñ•Ô∏è Function Declaration and Definition <a name="declaration-and-definition"></a>

- **Function declaration** - refers to the process of telling the compiler about a function name. Also called function prototype creation
- **Function definition** - refers to defining the body of a function (i.e. write logic inside the function body).
- There are three ways to declare a function:
   * Write your prototype into a separate file, and then use the #include directive to include it in your program.
   * Write the prototype inside your program before the main() function.
   * Define the function before it is called by any other function.
   * **Syntax:**

   **Note:** It is possible to combine the function declaration and definition. Refer to <a href="./Exercise-1.cpp">Example Code 1</a> 

### üñ•Ô∏è Functions calling and Excution <a name="call-excution"></a>

The figure below depicts the overall process of function calling and execution.

**Note:** A function can be called by either of the following data or by combining them. Refer through **Exercise 3 - 5**</a> 

     * variable/constant
     * literals
     * expression

### üñ•Ô∏è Parameters and Return type <a name="parameters-and-return"></a>
 
- Parameter means by which functions are communicating and passing data.
- Parameters are either Actual parameters or Formal Parameters. The figure below describes the difference between Actual and Formal parameters.

**Note** - A function can return any of the following. Refer through **Exercise 3 - 5**</a>

     * variable/constant
     * literals
     * expression
